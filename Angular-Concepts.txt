Core Angular Concepts
=====================
Modules
  => NgModule and its role in structuring an Angular app.
  => Feature modules and lazy loading.

Components
  => Component lifecycle hooks (e.g., ngOnInit, ngOnDestroy).
  => Component communication (Input, Output, EventEmitter).
  => Change detection.

Templates and Directives
  => Structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor).
  => Attribute directives ([ngStyle], [ngClass], custom directives).
  => Template reference variables and interpolation.

Dependency Injection (DI)
  => Services and providers.
  => Hierarchical injector.
  => Using @Injectable and understanding scopes.

Data Binding
  => One-way binding (interpolation and property binding).
  => Two-way binding ([(ngModel)]).
  => Event binding.

Routing
  => RouterModule and defining routes.
  => Route guards (canActivate, canDeactivate, etc.).
  => Lazy loading and preload strategies.
  => Query parameters and route parameters.

Forms
  => Template-driven forms.
  => Reactive forms.
  => Form validation (built-in and custom validators).

Advanced Angular Concepts
=========================
RxJS and Observables
  => Working with observables and operators (map, filter, switchMap, etc.).
  => Subjects and BehaviorSubjects.
  => Async pipe.

State Management
  => Component state vs application state.
  => Managing state with services.
  => Libraries like NgRx or Akita.

Change Detection
  => Zones and Angular’s default change detection mechanism.
  => OnPush change detection strategy.

Pipes
  => Built-in pipes (e.g., date, async, currency).
  => Creating custom pipes.

Testing
  => Unit testing with Jasmine and Karma.
  => End-to-end testing with Protractor or Cypress.
  => Mocking dependencies in tests.

Performance Optimization
========================
1. Lazy Loading Modules
    => Breaking large apps into smaller, lazy-loaded modules.

2. Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation
    => Difference between AOT and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation.

3. TrackBy with *ngFor
    => Improving performance in large lists.

4. Optimizing Change Detection
    => Using OnPush strategy when possible.

5. Tree Shaking and Bundle Optimization
    => Reducing the final bundle size with Angular CLI.

Ecosystem and Tools
==================
1. Angular CLI
    => Scaffolding, serving, and generating code.
    => Configuration and custom builders.

2. TypeScript
    => Decorators, interfaces, generics, and modules.
    => Strict typing for better code quality.

3. SCSS and CSS Styling
    => Component-specific styles.
    => Shadow DOM and view encapsulation.

4. Angular Material
    => Using prebuilt UI components.
    => Customizing themes and responsive design.

5. Third-party Libraries
    => Integration with libraries like PrimeNG, ngx-bootstrap, etc.

Other Important Concepts
========================
1. Authentication and Authorization
    => JWT, OAuth2.
    => Using HttpClient for API calls.

2. Internationalization (i18n)
    => Localization using Angular’s i18n tools.

3. Server-side Rendering (SSR)
    => Angular Universal for SEO and performance improvements.

4. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
    => Creating offline-first Angular apps.

5. Real-time Communication
    => WebSockets or SignalR with Angular.

Version-specific Features
=========================
Stay updated on the latest Angular features. For Angular 18, know the improvements or breaking changes introduced since previous versions.
